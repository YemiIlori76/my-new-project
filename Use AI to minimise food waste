Use AI to minimise food waste in the food industry, especially in bakeries or large food manufacturers, by predicting demand and optimising production schedules.

Background: Food waste is a major problem in the global food industry and represents both an economic and an environmental challenge. The extent of food waste in food production, especially in bakeries and large food manufacturing plants, is considerable. Food waste occurs at various stages, from the procurement of raw materials to production, packaging and distribution. For bakeries and food manufacturers, the problem often lies in overproduction caused by inaccurate demand forecasting and inefficient production planning.
Data and AI techniques: The most important role of AI in minimising food waste starts with accurately predicting demand. Predictive analytics is a branch of AI that uses historical data to make predictions about future events. Key techniques include:

Time series prediction: this technique uses historical sales data to predict future demand trends. Time series models such as ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average), Exponential Smoothing and more advanced methods such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks (a type of recurrent neural network, RNN) can be used to predict demand at different time intervals (e.g. daily or hourly).
Once demand is forecasted, optimising the production plan according to demand is crucial to reducing waste. AI techniques can help ensure that production is dynamically adjusted to avoid over- or under-production:

Integer Linear Programming (ILP): ILP is used to optimise production schedules by determining the best way to allocate limited resources (e.g. machines, raw materials) to maximise efficiency and minimise waste. This can help a bakery produce the right amount of each product based on projected demand while avoiding overproduction.

Reinforcement learning (RL): RL algorithms can be used for real-time optimisation of production schedules. An RL agent learns by interacting with the production environment and receiving feedback (rewards or punishments) based on its actions. Over time, it learns how to adjust production rates and schedules to minimise waste while meeting demand.

Genetic Algorithms (GAs): These optimisation techniques mimic the process of natural evolution and can be used to optimise complex production planning problems. For example, they can help to balance production across multiple product lines, taking into account constraints such as the availability of raw materials and machine downtime.
How is it used: AI is being used in a variety of ways to minimise food waste in bakeries and large food manufacturers. The most important areas in which AI plays a role include

Predicting demand more accurately to avoid overproduction
Optimising production schedules to adapt to real-time demand
Early detection of waste through computer vision and sensors
Managing inventory levels to ensure efficient utilisation of raw materials and products.
Introducing dynamic pricing to encourage the sale of perishable goods before they spoil.
Optimising the supply chain to reduce delays and spoilage.
As these AI techniques mature, they have great potential to further reduce waste, improve efficiency and contribute to a more sustainable food industry.
Challenges: Although AI is a promising approach to reducing food waste in the food industry, its successful implementation is associated with a number of challenges. These include the need for high-quality, integrated data, the cost and complexity of implementation, the adaptability of AI models to different environments and overcoming resistance to change. Overcoming these challenges requires investment in infrastructure, staff training, data integration and a commitment to long-term collaboration between technology providers and food manufacturers.

Overcoming these obstacles requires a step-by-step approach, starting with smaller, easy-to-use AI applications (e.g. demand forecasting) and gradually expanding to more complex systems (e.g. dynamic pricing and full production optimisation). With the right approach, AI can transform the food industry and make it more sustainable, efficient and waste-free.
What next: starting with data integration, selecting the right AI use cases, testing and scaling applications, and focusing on ethical and sustainable practicesâ€”bakeries and large food manufacturers can reduce food waste significantly. As AI technologies evolve and the data ecosystem improves, the impact of AI on food waste reduction will only grow, helping companies become more efficient, sustainable, and profitable.

In the future, AI has the potential not only to minimize food waste but also to create new opportunities for food businesses to optimize operations across the entire supply chain. Therefore, adopting AI now positions companies to stay ahead of market demands and environmental regulations, making a positive impact on both their bottom line and the planet.
